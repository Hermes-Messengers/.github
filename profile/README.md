Hermes MSSP has been contracted to perform a one-time adversary emulation engagement for SimCorp, a financial asset management company. The CTO is concerned with the security posture of the company's cloud systems, after having already experienced sensitive data exposure as a result of misconfiguration of an employee's instance. 

We were divided into two teams, red and blue, for the full duration of the project. The red team was tasked with discovering vulnerabilities on SimCorp systems and also exploiting them to gain access. The blue team (Hermes) was tasked with  overseeing the defensive systems and making meaningful improvements to threat detection capabilities.

In this engagement, the blue team took on a threat hunter role instead of incident response. The objective was to observe and document the progress of the adversary without interfering, treating the VPC like a honeypot. The team successfully evaluated SimCorp's blind spots and strengthened detection capabilities to ensure they didn't miss any important actions.

During the blue team staging, IAM user accounts were provided to access the AWS account and manage systems. Useful tools like Splunk Enterprise (SIEM) and Zeek (NIDS) were already set up. By the start of the project, the adversary already had a presence in the network.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Throughout the project, Hermes constructed an initial threat model DFD and performed a STRIDE analysis.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Deployed additional threat detection tools and monitoring solutions to enhance visibility across the environment.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Configured effective detection methods, such as IDS rules, to improve the defensive stance of the environment.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èImplemented detective controls for the web server hosting SimCorp's web application.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èObserved adversarial actions and collected evidence of scanning or TTPs used by the threat actors.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èBuilt/customized and fully implemented scripted automation that alerted the team to any adversarial activity.
